# System Design Resources

## Introduction
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making high-level technical decisions and creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Design Fundamentals
- System Architecture
- Scalability
- Performance
- Reliability
- Security
- Maintainability

### 2. Design Principles
- SOLID Principles
- DRY Principle
- KISS Principle
- YAGNI Principle
- Separation of Concerns
- Single Responsibility
