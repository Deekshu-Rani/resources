# Software Architecture Resources

## Introduction
Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system, including its components, relationships, and principles. It defines how different parts of the system interact and how the system evolves over time.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Architecture Fundamentals
- Architecture Patterns
- Design Principles
- Architectural Styles
- Quality Attributes
- Technical Constraints
- Business Requirements

### 2. Architecture Types
- Monolithic Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Layered Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Clean Architecture
